# Swagger Scalatra Example

This simple example demonstrates how you can use Scalatra with Swagger to document your services in a somewhat typesafe manner.I could not find any decent documentation with simple examples, so after I finally saw some code by @mostr, I decided to prepare one and describe it on my blog.

### How to run
* Use run.bat or run.sh to start sbt and build the app
* Open http://localhost:8080/api-docs/ in your browser to eplore api docs
